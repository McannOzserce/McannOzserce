# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @McannOzserce

I am a software developer passionate about back-end systems and the world of artificial intelligence.

My current focus isn't just on *using* AI models, but on opening up the "black box" to understand the fundamentals of how they "think" and learn.

---

## ðŸ”­ What Iâ€™m Focusing On

* ðŸ‘€ **Back-End Development:** Building robust and scalable server-side systems.
* ðŸŒ± **Artificial Intelligence & ML:** Moving beyond just using models to truly learning *how* they work, component by component.

---

## ðŸš€ My Current Project: AlgoSapiens

I believe the best way to learn is by building. With that philosophy, I am documenting my AI/ML learning journey in this project:

* **[AlgoSapiens](https://github.com/McannOzserce/AlgoSapiens):** My educational journey to understand the fundamentals of machine learning by coding a Decision Tree algorithm from scratch.
